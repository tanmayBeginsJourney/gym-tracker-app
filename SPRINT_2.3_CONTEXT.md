- **Standard**: Address ALL CodeRabbit suggestions (maintain "0 actionable comments" standard)
- **Focus Areas**: Chart performance, data aggregation efficiency, accessibility
- **Success Metric**: CodeRabbit approval with 0 actionable comments

### **Manual Testing Requirements**
- **Zero Tolerance**: No UI bugs, charts must render correctly on all screen sizes
- **Device Testing**: Test charts on actual device for touch interactions and performance
- **Complete Workflow**: Historical data â†’ Chart rendering â†’ Progress insights
- **Edge Cases**: No workout history, single workouts, large datasets
- **Performance**: Chart rendering with hundreds of data points

### **Quality Gates**
1. **Chart Performance**: Smooth scrolling and interaction even with large datasets
2. **Data Accuracy**: Progress calculations must be mathematically correct
3. **Visual Design**: Charts consistent with app aesthetic and readable
4. **Accessibility**: Chart data accessible via screen readers where possible
5. **Export Functionality**: Users can share/export their progress data

## Key Files to Consult
