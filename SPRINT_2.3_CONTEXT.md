# Sprint 2.3 Context: Progress Analytics Foundation

## Project Status
- **Sprint 2.1**: 100% complete, production-ready custom routine system
- **Sprint 2.2**: 100% complete, professional exercise library management (70 exercises)
- **Current State**: Complete workout creation ecosystem, ready for progress tracking
- **Next Goal**: Progress analytics system (charts, trends, personal records)
- **Working Branch**: `sprint-2.3-progress-analytics` (to be created from main)

## Development Workflow & Quality Standards

### **Git Branching Strategy**
- **Feature Branch**: `sprint-2.3-progress-analytics` (to be created)
- **Commit Pattern**: Regular commits with descriptive messages
- **Merge Strategy**: Merge to `main` after complete sprint review
- **Push Schedule**: Push regularly during development, final push after CodeRabbit review

### **CodeRabbit Review Process**
- **Required**: Submit all code for CodeRabbit review before sprint completion
- **Standard**: Address ALL CodeRabbit suggestions (maintain "0 actionable comments" standard)
- **Focus Areas**: Chart performance, data aggregation efficiency, accessibility
- **Success Metric**: CodeRabbit approval with 0 actionable comments

### **Manual Testing Requirements**
- **Zero Tolerance**: No UI bugs, charts must render correctly on all screen sizes
- **Device Testing**: Test charts on actual device for touch interactions and performance
- **Complete Workflow**: Historical data â†’ Chart rendering â†’ Progress insights
- **Edge Cases**: No workout history, single workouts, large datasets
- **Performance**: Chart rendering with hundreds of data points

### **Quality Gates**
1. **Chart Performance**: Smooth scrolling and interaction even with large datasets
2. **Data Accuracy**: Progress calculations must be mathematically correct
3. **Visual Design**: Charts consistent with app aesthetic and readable
4. **Accessibility**: Chart data accessible via screen readers where possible
5. **Export Functionality**: Users can share/export their progress data

## Key Files to Consult
- `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Complete roadmap and current status
- `src/services/storage.ts` - Workout data retrieval patterns (getAllWorkouts, etc.)
- `src/screens/ActiveWorkoutScreen.tsx` - Workout completion data structure
- `src/types/index.ts` - Workout, Exercise, Set type definitions
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Reference for consistent styling patterns

## Sprint 2.3 Requirements
1. **ProgressScreen Foundation** - New screen for progress visualization
2. **Strength Progression Charts** - Weight progression over time for exercises
3. **Personal Record Timeline** - Historical PRs with milestone celebrations
4. **Workout Consistency Analysis** - Streak tracking and frequency insights
5. **Volume Tracking** - Total weight lifted per session/week/month
6. **Exercise-Specific Trends** - Individual exercise performance charts

## Technical Architecture Notes
- **Chart Library**: Use react-native-chart-kit or victory-native for consistent rendering
- **Data Aggregation**: Create efficient service for workout history analysis
- **Performance**: Implement data pagination for large workout histories
- **Caching**: Cache aggregated data to improve chart loading times
- **Export**: Allow users to export progress data as images or CSV

## Data Sources Available
- **Completed Workouts**: Full workout history with sets, reps, weights
- **Personal Records**: Exercise PRs with timestamps
- **Workout Streaks**: Existing streak tracking data
- **Exercise Usage**: Frequency data from routine usage

## Chart Types to Implement
1. **Line Charts**: Weight progression over time
2. **Bar Charts**: Volume comparison (weekly/monthly)
3. **Calendar Heatmap**: Workout frequency visualization
4. **Progress Cards**: Key metrics with trend indicators

## User Behavior Patterns
- **Motivation-Driven**: Users want to see clear progress to stay motivated
- **Visual Learners**: Charts more impactful than raw numbers
- **Goal-Oriented**: Progress tracking helps users set and achieve goals
- **Sharing-Focused**: Users want to share achievements with others

## Critical Success Factors
- **Data must be accurate** - Incorrect progress data destroys user trust
- **Charts must be performant** - Smooth interaction even with large datasets
- **Visual design excellence** - Charts should look professional and be easy to read
- **Meaningful insights** - Not just data visualization, but actionable insights

## Potential Pitfalls
- Chart performance with large datasets (hundreds of workouts)
- Date handling across different time zones
- Handling missing data points gracefully
- Chart accessibility for screen readers

## Files to Create/Modify
- Create: `src/screens/ProgressScreen.tsx`
- Create: `src/services/analyticsService.ts` (data aggregation)
- Modify: `src/services/storage.ts` (add analytics queries)
- Modify: `App.tsx` (ensure ProgressScreen is properly integrated)
- Update: Navigation stack for progress screen access

## Code Quality Standards
- **Chart Performance**: Optimize for 60fps interactions
- **Data Efficiency**: Minimize memory usage for large datasets
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or corrupted data
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript for all analytics calculations
- **Loading States**: Proper skeleton screens for chart loading

## Sprint 2.3 Deliverables (4-5 days)

### **Day 1-2: Foundation & Data Layer**
- Create ProgressScreen.tsx with basic layout
- Implement analyticsService.ts for data aggregation
- Add chart library integration and basic chart rendering

### **Day 3: Core Charts Implementation**
- Strength progression line charts
- Volume tracking bar charts
- Personal record timeline visualization

### **Day 4: Advanced Features**
- Workout consistency heatmap
- Exercise-specific trend analysis
- Export functionality implementation

### **Day 5: Testing & Polish**
- Comprehensive manual testing
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX refinements and accessibility

## Success Metrics
- Users can see clear strength progression over time
- Personal records are visually highlighted with celebration
- Workout consistency provides motivational insights
- Charts load smoothly even with 100+ workouts
- Export functionality works reliably

## Integration Points
- **HomeScreen**: Add progress summary cards
- **ActiveWorkoutScreen**: Ensure workout completion data is properly saved
- **Exercise Selection**: Show exercise-specific progress when selecting

**ðŸŽ¯ Bottom Line**: Sprint 2.3 will transform raw workout data into meaningful progress insights through professional-grade charts and analytics. Focus on data accuracy, visual excellence, and performance optimization to create a motivational progress tracking experience.
