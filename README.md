- **Progress**: `progress_[exercise]_[date]` - Performance tracking
- **Chat History**: `chat_history` - AI coach conversations
- **Nutrition**: `nutrition_[date]` - Daily nutrition logs (Phase 3)

### Custom Routine System (Sprint 2.1)
```typescript
// Create custom routine
const routine: WorkoutRoutine = {
  id: 'custom_routine_123',
  name: 'Tanmay\'s Push Focus',
  exercises: [
    {
      exerciseId: 'bench-press',
      exerciseName: 'Bench Press',
      plannedSets: 4,
      plannedReps: 8,
      plannedWeight: 80,
      restTime: 180,
      order: 1
    }
  ],
  isCustom: true,
  estimatedDuration: 60
};

// Create weekly bundle
const bundle: RoutineBundle = {
  id: 'my_5day_split',
  name: '5-Day Power Split',
  routineSchedule: {
    monday: 'push_routine_id',
    tuesday: null, // rest day
    wednesday: 'pull_routine_id',
    thursday: 'push_routine_id',
    friday: 'legs_routine_id',
    saturday: 'upper_routine_id',
    sunday: null // rest day
  },
  isDefault: true
};
```

### Data Export/Import
```typescript
// Export all data (implemented in SettingsScreen)
const dataBackup = await storageService.exportAllData();

// Import data (restore from backup)
await storageService.importData(jsonData);

// Reset specific data types
await storageService.clearWorkouts();
await storageService.clearChatHistory();
```

## 🤖 **AI Coach Features**

### Multi-Provider System
The AI coach uses intelligent provider selection:
1. **Ollama** (local) - Private, fast, no internet required
2. **OpenAI** - High quality responses, requires API key
3. **Hugging Face** - Free tier backup option

### Context-Aware Intelligence
The AI coach has access to:
- Recent workouts (last 14 days)
- Personal records and strength trends
- Workout consistency and streak data
- Custom routine and bundle information
- User goals and preferences
- Current time/day context

### Example Interactions
```
You: "How's my progress this week?"
AI: "Great consistency! You've hit the gym 4 times this week using your 
     custom 5-Day Split. Your bench press increased from 80kg to 82.5kg 
     in your Push Focus routine. Keep it up! 💪"

You: "What should I focus on today?"  
AI: "It's Push Day! Your custom 'Tanmay's Push Focus' routine is scheduled. 
     Based on your last session, aim to match 82.5kg on bench or try for 
     85kg if you're feeling strong today."
