# Sprint 2.2 Context: Exercise Library Management

## Project Status
- **Sprint 2.1**: 100% complete, production-ready
- **Current State**: All UI/UX issues resolved, core workflow functional
- **Next Goal**: Exercise management system (create/edit/delete custom exercises)

## Key Files to Consult
- `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Complete roadmap and current status
- `src/data/exercises.js` - Exercise data structure and default exercises
- `src/services/storage.js` - Data persistence patterns (follow existing patterns)
- `src/screens/RoutineBuilderScreen.tsx` - Reference for modal/selection UI patterns
- `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions (Exercise, ExerciseCategory, etc.)

## Sprint 2.2 Requirements
1. **ExerciseManagerScreen** - New screen for exercise CRUD operations
2. **Advanced filtering** - By category, muscle group, equipment
3. **Custom exercise creation** - Full integration with routine builder
4. **Search functionality** - Efficient search across large libraries
5. **Exercise analytics** - Usage tracking and performance data

## Technical Architecture Notes
- Follow existing storage service patterns (`getAllExercises`, `saveExercise`, etc.)
- Use consistent modal patterns (85% screen height, proper background colors)
- Add proper logging with emojis (`if (__DEV__) console.log('üèãÔ∏è ExerciseManager - ...')`)
- Ensure 80px top padding for sidebar button clearance
- Add 80px bottom spacing for proper scroll behavior
- Use accessibility props for interactive elements

## User Behavior Patterns
- **Zero tolerance for UI bugs** - Test manually before declaring complete
- **Expects immediate functionality** - No placeholders or "coming soon" features
- **Values consistent spacing** - Follow established 80px patterns
- **Prefers descriptive logging** - Use clear console.log messages for debugging
- **Mobile-first approach** - Large touch targets, thumb-friendly UI

## Critical Success Factors
- **Custom exercises must integrate seamlessly** with existing routine builder
- **Performance matters** - Efficient handling of large exercise libraries  
- **Follow existing patterns** - Don't reinvent UI components or data flows
- **Complete the feature** - No partial implementations

## Potential Pitfalls
- Don't break existing exercise selection in routine builder
- Ensure custom exercises persist correctly in routines
- Handle edge cases (empty search, no custom exercises, etc.)
- Test on actual device for touch interactions

## Files Likely to Modify
- Create: `src/screens/ExerciseManagerScreen.tsx`
- Modify: `src/screens/RoutineBuilderScreen.tsx` (exercise selection)
- Extend: `src/services/storage.js` (exercise CRUD operations)
- Update: `App.tsx` (add new screen to navigation stack)

## Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
- Conditional logging with `if (__DEV__)` for performance
- Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions
- Use React Navigation's `reset` instead of hacky navigation patterns
- Add accessibility props (`accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`, `accessibilityHint`)

## Recent Fixes Applied
- Sidebar positioning and backdrop delay issues resolved
- Bottom spacing issues fixed across all screens
- Text overflow in hero cards resolved
- Reset functionality completely working
- All console logging made conditional for production builds

**Bottom Line**: Sprint 2.1 is rock-solid. Build Sprint 2.2 to the same quality standard using established patterns. Focus on the exercise management workflow that integrates seamlessly with existing routine creation.
